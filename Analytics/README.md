## [Alex Schultz Talks About Growth](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_yHZ_vKjno)

For any Startup, the first thing is to have good products. With good products, we can get users. Only after we get users, we can start thinking about retention. To have good retention is critical for your business. However, what is good retention can be very different depending on the business vetical. For Facebook, 80% retention is bad. For eCommence, 20% retention is good. For Netflix, the retention is about 91% (9% churn rate).

Good retention rate leads to growth. How does the growth look like? Does it look healthy? There must be a North Star for Growth for different business. For Facebook in early days, the North Star is Monthly Active User (MAU) not registered user. For Whatsapp, it's daily sent messages not the DAU. For AirBnB, it's the daily booked nights vs hotels. For Uber in early days, it's the driver numbers. 

One key to good retention is for users to experience the Magic Moment while using your products/services. For Facebook, it's the time when users see friends' pictures, messages, status, etc. When that happens, they get hit and that is the Magic Moment for them. When Facebook reached 50M users, they were afraid because no social media had ever gone pass 100M users yet. At that time, they focused on **10 friends in 15 days** for every new user. This was critial. They did it and they succeeded.
